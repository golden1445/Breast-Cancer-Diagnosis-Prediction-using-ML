# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-Prediction-using-ML
Built a machine learning model to predict breast cancer diagnosis using real-world medical data. Implemented and evaluated Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifiers with performance analysis using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC visualizations.
This project focuses on predicting breast cancer diagnosis (Benign or Malignant) using real-world medical data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Multiple machine learning models were implemented to understand, compare, and evaluate classification performance on medical datasets.

The project includes Gaussian Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, implemented both from scratch and using scikit-learn, to demonstrate strong conceptual understanding as well as practical ML skills. Model performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC–AUC curves.

This project highlights end-to-end machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.
